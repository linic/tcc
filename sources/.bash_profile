# exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
# This command replaces your current shell process with a new, minimal environment bash shell. Let me break down what it does:
# exec - Replaces the current process (your shell) with the command that follows, without creating a new process
# env -i - Starts with an empty environment (clears all environment variables)
# HOME=$HOME - Preserves only the HOME environment variable from your original environment
# TERM=$TERM - Preserves only the TERM environment variable (for terminal capabilities)
# PS1='\u:\w\$ ' - Sets a minimal prompt showing username, current directory, and $ character
# /bin/bash - Launches bash as the new shell
# This creates a "clean" bash environment with minimal variables defined. It's often used in build scripts or
# when you want to ensure a consistent, controlled environment without inheriting potentially problematic
# environment variables.
# Since it uses exec, your current shell process is completely replaced - you can't return to your previous
# shell by simply typing "exit". You would need to start a new terminal session to get back to your normal environment.
# This approach is sometimes used in Linux From Scratch or similar systems where you're building a new
# environment and want to isolate it from the host system's environment variables.
exec env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' /bin/bash
